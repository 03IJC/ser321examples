# ser321examples

All examples in this repository are for you to play with and to learn about the different concepts in this class. This repo is still a "living" thing. As we progress we might add more examples or make changes. 

It is advised that you fork this repository so that you have your own version and can also make changes to your own repo to test different scenarios. If we make changes to the repository we will notify you in the Slack #example_repo channel. 

All examples are developed by the teaching team:

Many examples are used and adapted from Dr. Lindquist and Dr. Gary.

Others were developed by Dr. Mehlhase, David Clemens and Aman Kaushik.

Feel free to play with these examples, the better you understand these small examples the easier your coding assignments will be. 

Best

Dr. Mehlhase
